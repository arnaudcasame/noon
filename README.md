# nono

nono is a DOM utility module that group several functions ready  to use and make javascript coding easy in a jQuery style.
This module provides a simplified interface to the complicated DOM selection problem, hides the chaos from you and lets you free to not using all the nasty javascript codes to interact with it.

Note: To start this project: 
	1. I used the revealing module pattern so that users can have access to the only functions that can help them interact with the DOM. 
	2. The Facade Pattern was used to build the DOM manipulation functions.

Not to forget, I'm developping this module for the fun to use my own framework on my projects and this is a way for me to experiment the JavaScript Patterns that I master.

## Installation

Very easy to install. Just clone the repo and then add the dsm.js module to your project as if you were adding the jquery module to it.

Feel free to contribute whenever you want, just clone the repository and then add your own function.
